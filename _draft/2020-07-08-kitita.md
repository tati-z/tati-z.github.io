title: save the bananas
---
Below is an extract from a personal (some opinions are objective, some are subjective, other are neither, some are both), relection on July 8th at 6pm, after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bm5NWCMlPo).

>- time 18:25: wait. I am currently watching how the banana industry is doomed because there is a fungi that kills plantations where monoculture performed in the Banana Republic but also in the Philippines, etc. Then something interesting, that answers my question from 6 years ago makes me blush: **why do bananas in Ireland don't taste as good as the ones we have in the Congo?**

- It turns out, these plantation used to grow the banana breed we had in the congo: Gros Michel. This is the part I leaped, because I rememered my mom used to call it like that... These are the bananas that I grew up with in my mouth. They are bigger compared to the one in Ireland, and are flavorsome. Just like they descibed them as. But they were highly infectious because of a fungi, Luis had commented earlier. They then changed that banana that once riped the whole banana industry to the banana we consume today "Cavendish" that has a lesser good taste, but was much more robust to the fungus.  Because it is also grown as a monoculture= many of the same, or as they described it (turns the forest into a factory).

- When one plant gets infected, this plant become able to infect others. I guess through the fungi network I because this is the only way it could infect the whole plantation including the soil. (This is literally Chapter 2 in the Hidden Life of Trees in action)

- time 18:32: The video continue and introduces a banana that doesn't get yellow when it's ripe. I know it. We used to have it in the congo and we used to eat it like a vegetable. It's consumed before it's rippen, and it is called: kisamunyu in Swahili. I used to be fascinated about it and was wondering if bananas come from it. But I was often dissapointed when I would take one or two away in the shade until they were ripe just to realise they weren't turning into babanas. They would remain green, but not too green like they would when they were bought off in the market. They weren't as sweet as bananas even when ripe. They had a lesser sweet but had a somewhat sour-like taste but really they were just unique in their own way as well as my faourites as I didn't have a sweet tooth.

I would always scan for ripe ones when we would buy their hands, a hand was one pack of banana sticking onto each other. There are also others that were small bananas, they are called "Kamera" in Swahili but I used to call them baby bananas. They were sweet banana, they would ripe to yellow, but they had a tiny flavour that I didn't quiet like and preferred actual banana to them. To me, they would be what mandarin are compared to Oranges. I never liked the taste of madarin either so I always stick to lemons or Oranges. Our Lemons were also green even when ripe, the oranges were less sweet, and I prefered my lemon with salt and peper even if they were more sour than the ones we have here but that's a different story. 

- There were more. There were a type of bananas that my grand mother on my mom side used to make an alcohoolic drink called Kasiksi. These would ripen to purple-ish and had less of a sweet taste, but had their own flavour that I still prefered to the sweet bananas. I also prefered these to the green riped bananas, but these were very rare and I had to be luky to find them at their place before she had placed them in barrels.

I also liked the alcooholic drink that resulted from it, but just after a day or 2 of fermentation because after this duration the flavour from this the "bananas" would have almost faded away completly as the drink would have turned into Kasiski. Up until now, it was called Mutobe. Mutobe was still somewhat sweet, and the achool was not too strong whereas Kasiski was much fluvorless as it was more about the alcohool. To drink both though you had to blow into the the cup to separate the sorgho bits out. I would always strain it even if traditionally that blowing was a part of the experience in drinking it.. My dad would make a joke calling the gesture "I regret" because he involved swinding your head left then rightwards. Mutobe was my favourite alchoolic drink before I discovered Palm wine. And just like Palm wine, the more you keep it away the less sweet it becomes, obviously because alcohoolic fermentation turns sugar and others into alcohol.

- Lastly, the famous plantains, that I love boiled and not fried, unlike Ornella. I don't know why she fries them before they are about to rippen when they taste better when fried at this specific state of their decomposition. Anyway, not my problem. I don't boil my plantain until they are exactly ripe. Not somewhat, not too much. If I boil them before this point:
	Too ripe: why didn't I just eat them like bananas?
	Too not-ripe: Their taste tend to be just as dull as Bisamunyu (plural of Kisamunyu; not Kisamunyu~~s~~ ).

I think all of these varieties can be found in african and asian shops here, though I don't think they have the ones that are used to make Mutobe <3, -- I will ask mom for their name later. But I find their plantains tasteless sometimes.

To be specific, in my opinion at least, it's not the lack of sweetness compared to other bananas that put the ones here astrey, or the colour/lack of imperfection in their skins (whose fate awaits in **bins** either way). Even if the varieties slightly differ in nutrition values, I would be more drawn to _grabbing a second finger_ from a ripen Cavendish's hand than a Gros Michel's for not having a sweet tooth. However, its half baked flavour woulnd't make it to the next peel in the next months.<br>Other varieties would if consumed just before they ripen. (Papayas and mangos would be crunchy and tangy at this stage <3))

The reason why the industry reinforces Cavendish is.. what pains me. I was about to say "is laughable", but then I felt this whole thing too strongly, it hurt. When in the video they said that: **...americans buy with their eyes.**
• This explained to me why the bananas here are always so perfect in the shop. They would have spots on them in the Congo but we never really cared. Here they look thin and spotless, but I wonder if buyers know. 

> **Imagine somebody dying without knowing how a banana taste like?!**<br>


> Can I say: I know how lies taste like?

• Before saying that the reason spotless bananas are marketed is to me: laughable, the reporter had also said something that I found touching, yet again:

- **"by demanding the cheapest, most uniform product in our lunch boxes, we don't just run the risk of loosing the almighty banana, but also the biodiversity of life on earth."**
	
- The plant researcher and Banana breeder then responded **"... we also have to change the mind of the market and the consumers. Scientist cannot do it. This is a work that perhaps you, who is working in media, you can promote this idea."**
	
- To which the reporter replies: **"I will save the bananas for you"**
	
• I am going to put this on my website, too.

Time 20:24: I have now over the video on but I am still thinking about all the workers that work so hard, they remind me of jobs that I spawn in the background as Daemon threads when I write code. Something is feeling wrong, and I don't know if this is even titled right. Save the bananas? Okaythese workers could be doing something more creative if they weren't worried about bananas. In countries that consume these bananas, we don't worry about bananas, it's a "part of" our lives, but we wouldn't be as affected as them if.. Yet they are generations out there, that spend their lives doing nothing, nothing else than.. huh.. I am just worried if they had choices before deciding this is what they wanted to do, or if they did it because they had no other thing to do..

Time 20:27 When I was a kid, we used to have a banana plant at home.. it was my grandma's on my fathers' side.. I don't know if I told Leasha about this bananas the other day when I asked her if she knew how carrot grew. or when I pointing to my house and said: "the one with a tomato in the brown pot" after she asked me where is my house. She didn't know how carrots grow, and using peanuts as a hint didn't work. Patatoes helped.
Now I know how cherries grow because of her. "The ones you buy in the shop?!". I had to ask again to make sure that the tree that was in front of me was the one whose fruits I was familiar with, and whose seeds I read in the books and went to look up online just to make sense of what the relationship it had with birds was all about. It was like being in the front row at Zaz's or the X Ambassador's conerts where atop of having them singing directly to me, I got to learn the actual story behind the songs that had made me singging and dancing to the sound of my heart's beat. ~~now just have to wonder if the story wasn't made up~~

Maybe I can tell her that: we used to grow a banana in our front garden, and every time we would harvest the arm, it woud have left behind a baby banana plant, but atop of that, we had to protect it with a small fence because there were goat that loved the banana leaves, like they would always eat away our avocado tree's leaves before they had the chance to grow past my knees.
You know what's funny, now that I would have remembered that: sometimes we would also put goat feces on the avocados leaves and because goats always smell everything before they eat it, tey would walk away immediatly and spare the poor baby tree. But we had to repeat this with every new node but we often forgot and so more often than not, the crowns of the avocado trees were always eaten away.

21:08 I remember after my first dose of dissapoitment in tastes when I peeled a banana, I yet had to watch my bar of expectations fall even lower than the percentage of gold in my body. As soon as pineaples didn't taste as good either, I assumed: genetic modifications. But usually scientists do this for the greater good. Right? Well, "scientists" wouldn't deprive wolves their hunting abilities to a point where my hands wouln't become tasty if I placed it in their mouth.. right? right? I am sure the university lied in our Entreprise Architechture and Application lecture where they explicitly told us that "the advancements in technology exists to make profit."

Obviously they didn't mean it because: what gain is there exactly in missing out on experiences?

> Could I be missing out without even knowing I am missing out?

**If I hadn't graduated I would have aksed: who exactly is making a profit? And how? Using who? And why can't they.. do it themselves?**

It's only last week on Thursday that I went to a friend's house and when I she gave me a tour of her garden where nostagia placed its right hand on my shoulders after I saw her rampant bean and courgette leaves that she had no idea were edible. The only greens I see in most shops here are mostly spinach. They don't even taste near as good either but I guess it's a different variety all together. The spinach in the Congo is slimy in texture like those vegetable: dongo dongo. The cabbage here is too sweet, more on the whiter than the green side and flavourless in comparaison also. 

Now that I think about it, in the Congo, it is much easier to be a vegan, much easier in fact, it's madly taken for granted when not considered as a low status symbol. And unless you said you were sick, no other reason was comprehensible.

Time 21:22 I wonder if people who have eaten meat their whole lives ever taken the time to: listen to their body, just like I would be curious to know if they ever wondered if a banana could ever have a different taste.

Few month ago I had difficulties eating bacon/eggs after a yoga session, but no problem at all if I had skept the sceance. It's something I noticed but didn't think too much about it, like what? "listen to my body" what kinda freak does that? Now that I stop sometimes and reflect about little things and wonder why I think about them the way I do, I became sliglty able to explain some of the loathings -- reasons why I would sometimes go a full days without feeling hungry, finding myself eating just because I had to.

Lumiere would tell me I had found a cure for hunger, to witch I would return a contrite smile after feeling too well I could actually have an eating disorder and I didn't even knowing it until lately. Sometimes after being asked for the 61st time: "are you coming for breakfast?" I would return: "I will just sink my feet, drink water and open my hands to the sun". Then I would laugh before looking down realising I wasn't being funny, when in reality I would only drink water for like the whole day, after skipping breakfast for like 24 hours.

> One day, over some breakfast, I asked a friend: "where did the seeds in the orange go?" 

> Are we teaching the little ones that Oranges aren't supposed to have seeds in them? Like they now know that banana are supposed to be thin and spotless?

> What does this make me when I slice a lemon and search for them?

Should I be feeling bad? Even if genonme editing reason cats now glow? But how are they supposed to camouflage now?
When we leave street lights on all night long, how are trees supposed to sleep?

I didn't know just how many seeds a plant could produce for a chance of having at least "ONE" tree replace it in its life time until I had read chapter 5 of the Hidden Life of Tree. For a plant that produces a million seeds, this made me close the book for that day, for I didn't feel sorry for the plants, but for the mutation that turn us into species, that our invironment and other species needed to be are ready for.

Plants exhange sugar and nutients throught their fungal network, of course disease also. This exchange also happens when plants living close to one another let their roots graft onto eachother to share water, etc. But nonetheless, could we be using the wrong currency? Aferall money comes and go, time doesn't run out, it keeps moving forward after our death, but energy runs out per individual, certainly, well, not quiet because its transformation is the reason we still have few decade before running out of fossil fuel. But why does time feels more like a concept than something that is actually real? Something as man made as fences and borders?

> Leasha once told me she went online to look up on how to care for her pet snail and they asvised to get a cage. At this time she said that she was keeping it in a jar covered with holes at the top. As we were skating, she would stop every two meters her and the other kids and uploug the poor snails under the fences and behind leaves. I asked them why can't they just leave them there and come to visit them every time? "they are so cute" was Freddy's answer. "They will go away". was the complain of the others. But that's what they are supposed to do.. I said to them.. They need to feed themselves and move from place to place if the place here becomes inadequates. They are snai- just as I said that, the skating sceance had almost stopped as every kid now had one of them in their hand. "this snail must be so confused right now". I don't know what parents do, but to me this behaviour is not something to fix now, because if these kids have already been to the zoo before, they might aggree that animals belong in cages, and if they got a dog for chrismas because it is cute, what chance do I have here? They were all less than 8, but they already knew they had to colonise other species. This is the moment where I should have spoken up, but I just didn't know where to start, cause talking doesn't work. The system is moves ahead of me. <br>

> To catch up I would need to bring them to a Safari, bring them snorkerling, hiking, birdwatching, laying down on the grass for no reason; after I would have thirly resolved how the grass feels after we sit on it, definitly beaten up after festivals.<br>
> How does the wild and marine life feel when we come to visit, when even among us humans, not everyone likes strangers. We'd equally lock our doors if there was boa silthering through our streets, looking for its way back home.<br>
> Maybe I can simply tell them that **there was once a spider on my wall few weeks ago, and my first instinct was to kill it**. But I stopped. I asked myself why am I feeling like kiling it? It's just climbing up my wall. "I am scared it will go where I can't see it", was my answer. Why am I scared it will go where I can't see it? I asked myself. Some spider in the congo leave irritation if they walk on your skin. Even if I really can't prove it because I didn't see them the day I woke up with bumps on the back side of my neck whose foorprint could still be [visible to date in form of scars?](/public/assets/images/can_you_see_it.JPG), plus I wouldn't want a spider to get into my ear. I added. And so I concluded: **So it's my inability to control my own fear of "not being in control of a spider's move" that's making me want to kill this spider climbing up my wall?** I said yes. I had leant something new about myself, I felt sorry about myself. All that happened in less than 15 minutes, and after this, I knew who was the enemy, so I switched sides. And because I took time to study the situation, I was able to forgive myself.<br>

>I then started watching the spider. Just few minute later I realised that it was struggling a lot to make it up.. so much so it would hang 7 of its feet, and scan the texture on the wall with the remaining 3, but still would struggle to move up a millimeter. Sometimes it had to repeat this 4 to 5 times. My first instinct here became, to help it. Pick it up and.. I didn't know which part of my wall it was climbing to, why it was climbing my wall, was it running away from something? Is it right to assume it's aiming to build a web on the ceilling?. I also wondered, what it is going to think if it realises I lift it up? Would it be traumatised? Does it believe in miracles? Will it be able to take an actual "miracle" in a spider world? I myself don't believe in high power, I guess there is nobody watching over me. So I stopped. Then I realised the spider started moving diagonaly to the left, like a bishop. Up until now I thought it was only moving up, like a pawn. The texture of the wall on the left though was very very smooth for the spider. I looked at it, I couldn't tell a difference. In this moment I said if the builders had made my wall rougher, this spider would have needed that friction. But it struggled so much to move forward, it started moving accross, but to the right side. It had almost made it in the middle of the wall. I had woken up at 4am I think, when I found it at 25%, it was now 10 pm. I didn't want to have breakfast. I didn't want to leave my room. I cancelled all my plans to go out: there was a spider on my wall. I didn't want to miss a thing. At this stage, i was no longer the same person who thought about killing it or throwing it outside my bedrom window. Watching the spider, I was touched by its perceverance, I look at it and look at me, we all just want the same thing: get ahead in life. I then imagine playing chess and watching a pawn struggling to make it up. This spider was now a queen. It's never hard for a queen to make it up. But in the spider world, every pawn is a queen. I wanted to be like this spider. Be able to change my mind when the environment is not favourable, wait as long as possible until I have enough energy, trip, twice, scan my environment again and again, and be willing to try again and again. It still hadn't eaten anything, I had willingly skipped dinner the day before. Now I was rooting for it. So much so I picked up my kalimba and played a tune to encourage it that I called : If I make it up. at 3pm it was still in the same spot. I had skept lunch. I didn't see it eating anything since 4am. did I pack lunch? I didn't have any insect, but I this time I was still eating meat. So I run downstairs and brought lunch for myself. then tried to sellotapea little piece of turkey on my wall that I had chewed slightly to make it soft for the spider. It didn't hold with the clear sellotape but one of my paining velcros worked.. I didn't want to block its path with that food, so I placed it slightly ahead of it, but not too far either so it doesn't spend too much energy climbing up. I wondered if I was going to traumatise it with that, and when it took a while without approaching it, I became worried that it didn't like it. So I went online and searched "how to care for a pet spider". One of the steps was "get a cage".
When I read that, I closed that tab, and looked at my friend: **outside my bedroom window is definitly not safe for you**. I said to it. It was still in the same spot. Its name was now "kali". I didn't want to interfere with its world. I wasn't scared anymore it came to interfere with mine. In fact, I felt grateful it stopped by. If it had a better place, it could have evolved to be there already. My room is better than "outside my bedroom window" or worse, "inside a tissue". Sometimes there are little insects that wander about my lights. I can be playing the kalimba for Kali, and it can be keeping the insects away from me. It was a deal. But it hadn't move since, it was now 7pm. It was closer to the turkey though, but I don't know if it ate it or if I put too much of it..
What I realised though, for a while, it stayed clinging on the velcro above the turkey, so I said to myself. It might have not like the turkey, but the velcro must have had enough friction to make it save energy instead of clinging on the bare wall.
At 1am, it started moving away from the turkey. I think I died on my bed at 3am. before this, it was now about 20cm moving downwards like a rook. The next day when I woke up it was gone. I guess, back to: under my bed. I felt so sad and slightly lonely. But I am sure it could have stayed if where it was was better for it. The turkey is still on my wall though, hanging by, and to the same value as my paintings, but only it painted to my heart, a picture of a friend that maybe one day will come back again. (And if it doesn't I hope it's okay, and if I ever go visit and don't see it, when it is naughty again and its parents kicks it out of the web for a day, I hope it finds on my wall: a safe place to stay)

They would probably be lost by now, but I hope they would understand that a pet doesn't have to fit my ideals of being to be mine. It can be its own person when I am my own person, it can be with me or away from me, it won't mean I care any less. It all start by looking at thing from the other side's perspetive, but when you turn your back away from your fears, that becomes the side you'll overlook.<br>
Maybe with this when they go to the zoo next time, they won't learnt that animals belong in cages, maybe when they look at how their dog's behaviour when they come back home to it, they might start to wonder if dog care, just like child care, shouldn't already be a thing.

...

If the universe was a ~~fast fourier transform, everything would have its magnitude in the frequency dom-~~ clock, sometimes I imagine everything as having its own needle.

But if everything is always in motion, like a movie, why? and would there be a way to freeze it? Will it ever end? It's aways transforming, but what will it become? Would it ever go back to its original point? would it start all over? would it be the same? would any of this have mattered? Why are we the only specie on earth that cares about history? goes to school? Are we the only specie? Are we doind our jobs? do we have a due to the planet? Could over 90% of our DNA realy be rubbish or that's a cover up for non published research that explains why we are the way we are?!

> Why didn't we discuss about these things in schools?? teachers: are they hiding something? Who decides what we learn and the questions we ask?
> Are plants the only thing being colonised? Chikens, Cows? the leather industry, animal body parts, and those in labs? Why did "free range became a thing", and why was "fair trade" ever unfair?

Isn't it called slavery when somebody's freedom is decided by somebody else?

Were does this leave these workers, who have been working on bananas for the rest of their lives? How are they feeling? What does this make me when I buy these bananas, and when I need this food to survive? 

Like the other time when I came to conclude that only the dead and the unconcious are truly free, but that's 360 degrees, compared to all the numbers in the degree of freedom that goes from physical slavery, mental slavery, to living under the rock, to moving in the forest, until you want nothing more and become somewhat free through.. what? death?. But everything is always in motion, so even the dead don't even get to enjoy their death before moving onto something else?

> So are the workers mentally enslaved? Could the theory of relativity apply to this too? i.e. relative to .., I could perceive the as not free?
I feel it could be a thing. A situation where options are taken away from you to leave you the only one you think is: your idea.

> Could somebody be mentally slave without even knowing it?

> If I only have one choice of bananas every time I shop, how hard is it to make a "good" choice?

> Should it not be illegal to remove options, like it is almost never good for the consumer where there is a monopoly of the market on the producer? Could competition help here?

> What if the cards turn? Like in "how to train your dragon finale" when Toothless became the alpha?

Am I coulour blinds or all the pieces on in this board have the same colour?<br>
Mentally slavery. Like not being able to move a pawn forward because of: 

If in this chess board the game makes a winner to one party either way, what's exactly is the fair in fair trade when farmers the lowest share? Did they participate in the making of the rules of the game? Is the "fairness" relative to something? Like what? Relative to their currency's exchange rate? But in comparaison to which decided by who?

I am I being sceptical?

> Should I still put this on my website?<br>
Am I mentally free if I am asking myself that question?

The reason dogs can't wait for their "master" to come back, the reason we have tasty watermelons? We don't grow these in the congo, we have Maboga -- courge in french. We eat them as vergetable. My mostly hated vegetable probably. I wonder how varieties taste like.. Maybe it's the one we had in the Congo that just tasted bad, I mean watermelons that look almost the same are my favourite fruits. I guess I have no other variety to comapare it to? Courge? Yike. Wait. What? They are in the same family "Cucurbitaceae". Wait what? Yellow watermelon exists! What there are over 1200k varieties of watermelons?? 

... 

### `15/07/2020 -- 03:24 (update)`

For over 30 seconds I remained at rest. Until I came back to myself.
