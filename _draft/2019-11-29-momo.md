title: M<i>oh</i>saics — when tilted heads fall on strait lines.
---

Long introduction short, year 4 of see ess was a scam. But.<br>
The good news was: assigments were of **_topics of you interes-_ SOCKS!** No. She said.<br>Then why d `*curse word*` say topics of int<del>o</del>eRest -- _what did you say?_ Nothing.<br>
Afterwards when the predictability of prime numbers also became too unpredictable, I decided to settle for any topic that'll come with stairs to keep me up all night. Unfortunately the flight to the 4th dimension landed off topic, so find below a **walk ~~through~~** something pulled off a hat.

## Oh, Mosaics!

**Printing like in the old days? Rings a bell?** Now I read like a boomer.<br><br>
When I looked at the patterns, the ringing bell wasn't the E note from highschool bells that caused me to regulate my internal clock for anticipation modes, but the good one; the one that triggered a what _if_ statement.

_then_ `this.happened`:

01:59am: environment update: there is a star in the sky but it looks like a satellite.<br>
02:00am: environment update: "the star" just dissapeared. (just in time?)<br>

**More**

04:05am: environment update: an artistic rain hasn't stopped doodling behind my glass. I would like to stay and keep it company for even longer, but I am going to have to go to sleep now. For health purposes :(
