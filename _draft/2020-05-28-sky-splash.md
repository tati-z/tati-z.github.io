# Spray?, Acryl? (One of them is the name of this post)

In the same mimalist series, I want to be able to spray over a minimal art.<br>
At first I was like, yeah, maybe just splash over it, some colors at random pixels.<br>
I was so sure of this idea than the name of the file containing this post is called sky splah, for I was planning on using shades of blue. But when I started writting the actual post I 'Spary' came first. 

> And as I know me, getting random ideas like this is not good.

Mmm.. anybody said spray? Some neurons in my brain screamed. Wow, this is going to be sooo cool, the look on my face confirmed.
Guys calm down, we are splashing thing. My brain's internal clock is ideas late.

> No we are spraying now..? What are we spraying again?

Okay, the idea with the splash was to be in possesion of colors. N colors ranging from 0 to 16million.
Then These colors will have weights.. For example. Let we have colors C0: .2, C1:.5 etc. The sums of colours in will add to 1. 
If you only have C0 and C1 like in the example above, then we have .7 space to splash in the image, and we need to leave .3 space as is.

There are no default color. The nothing is a color, and so it takes the remaining .3.<br>

Think of it as an empty sheet of A4 page. Think of all the things that you can write on it.<br>
All the things in the world, in all languages that exist. Everything you could draw/paint on it. All the origami shapes you could fold with it and everything you could do with it.<br>
Then immagine you were only given this one piece of paper.<br>

If this example was that one piece of paper, then you would have written C0 over 20% of it, and C1 over 50% of the page, not 50% of the remaining space, unless you prefer to count it that way, but it's not necessary for now.

Now imagine how hard it could be to find things worthy of filling it.<br>
That hardness is the reason why emptiness also counts.

So what I wanted to do with the colours was to find a way to colorise this space artistically or however it will turn out to be, until Graffiti got whispered in my ears.. No I mean sprays.

And.. why is this is useful again?
That's the question I used to say I would still ask my physics teacher from high school, until I recently found myself watching physic videos, wondering why I was finding it hard stopping when skating downhill. <br>

The short answer is: there is a use for it, but if I said it to you today you'd be too yound to understand it.

.. Then I wanna try?

Then never stop.

Not even after I've found the answer?

Not even after it'd become a question.

# What the -- is being talked about?!

Honestly I don't know how the graffiti are going to look like. Over a minimal image? What exactly do I want?

I am on my phone searching for graffitis, but apparently I have been collecting murals instead..
Let's see if inspiration is hiding behind them//

> If I were digging this sentence would be a stone.

Okay it's now 03:55am And I started this at.. after 01:09. I need to come up with an idea now or else I will have to wait 24 more hours.
What if I forget about murals and grafitti and inks?

> I just want instead, have a representation, an artististic one of the, percentage filled. Omg is that the sun?
04:01: Okay, I can create some sort of camera. A fictional one. Then the further away it is from the image the larger space it will cover. It's like picking a book in the library.. If you are too close to the shelve you see one book. If you step away, you see more. Or living with people. When you are always there, they fail to see the details of you with their eyes, then when you go away, they start seeing it with their feelings.<br>

With this close and apart picture in ind I can quantify the percentages. And depending on where the camera is.. will I need a light source to draw the shadows? Hmm.. how is this idea not too complicated?

Omg, I have always wanted to do something with reflections and shadows. Maybe instead of using a shade of blue I could use a shade of grey. Colourless. Hmm.. I need texture of.. I need a 3d object that can draw its shadow on the image, then the result could be a blend of that shadow with the minimal image? I don't think I can translate from a 2d plane to a 2d plane unless I am only converting from one basis vector to another.. I will need a shadow effect.. maybe I can find a way to cnvert images into their shadows?

No shadows are projectiond from a hiher dimension to a lower one, unless I could.. huh shadows are better dawned with light, but why exactly. Huhh

There is a moonlamp on my desk.. It's all red right now. If it were multicolor, All those colours would have been drawned on my laptop, or rather blend themselves in the air and draw their mixture on the laptop? Wait one light can't have two colours at at time then? This lamp is projecting its light on the surface of my laptop. Or on every surface of the laptop that hits its ray. Maybe all I need is a gradien creation algorithm.. Create an illusion of where the light source is and get each pixel colour itself respective of how away it is from it. The ensemble of points that hits the surface of the image is their values .2, .5.<br>
Or even better. If G0, G1 were their own papers, let say G1 was 10 papers. And that This art had value 20% of its for G1. Then the value of G1 for this art needs to be relative to the entirity of G1. 

> Yes, Imma just gonna leave that there, and go to sleep.

04:23: So, for reasons only I know, It's going to be even rarer to have values that are high for any of those Gs. This means there will be less space to splash.<br>
For this reason I am thinking there are fonts out there that could behave as graffiti if I used them to write gibrerish-like letters that those graffitis are anyway, the apply alpha blending on them for artistic effects. I just don't know if I want gaps in between holes of the image when I apply the minimal image on it. 

> How can too colouful and too minimal mix without coming out as too much is my new problem.<br>
> Or rather, could the difference between these two extremes complement one another?

There are going to be many colours. Many of the small colours.

04:27: F it, going to bed.

# 14:08pm. Okay, let's start over.

I will need inspiration. 30GB of it.

Listening to [Avatar uncle's tsungi horn (music)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjObRm9e81Y), I am thinking..
What if I created an effect of the image being blown in the wind?<br>

> I would need a wind direction like a need a slight source..
> can I use vector fields on this? Generate a fluid-dynamic-like flow? I want random ones. but ordered randomness: chaos. theory. Nono this is not metereology, but clouds are// huh okay pass.
> But.. Multivariate Transformation, do they nvm

Okay So what do we have now?

1. Minimal image from previous blog.
2. Color splashes we don't know yet how to implement, but that will be mixed relative to a light source?
4. Graffitis with alpha blended letters in the gradient?
5. Hot wind melting off the minimal image.
6. Everything else we don't know we will need, just yet.
