*#Take 2*

If I remember ..., I wanted to convert videos into books before accidently deleting everything I had written up until OVeR hAlF Of THIS PAGE -angry face-!

The reason I wanted to convert videos into books

- had space filling curves in it,
- lied on the projection from a Real plane to a Complex plane,
- mentioned degrees of neural connectivity and neuroplasticity,
- but also multidimentional thinking?
-    
-   
- guess we'll never know. Moving on...

It's **~~sensory overload!~~**

> Shut up!

# RAW data//
Okay after unpacking the RAW data, and singling out what I need, 
I don't care about the escaped quotes because: *regexp.*

What I didn't know though, was that there were new lines, reading between the lines. 
![dirty](/public/assets/images/dirty1.png)

This explains why lines in the earliest versions of this attempt never went past half of the screen.

![old version](/public/assets/images/old_attempt.png)

I liked this version a lot. It was CLI- based, and worked well. BUT. I HAD TO BE (OR NOT TO BE) On my~~**?**~~ "lap" "top".

With future versions, I want each line to be associated with links to timestamps, or maybe every 5 lines or so? so that I can jump to the point in the video if I decide: **I feel like it.**

# In the end,

~~Someday I may implement PDF format, if the need calls for it, but right now,~~
I am aiming for EPUB for its reflow feature that PDF doesn't know the smell of.

![uuu](/public/assets/images/uuuuu.png)

But also the ability to scan through a videos' content like... this:

So I can do...

### End Credits roll 

<b>Erm, which song should accompany the credit roll now, hmm..</b>
Let me think.<br><br>
How about this one.. "Quiter Than Silence"?!

...

> Play it faster than slow.


<br><br>
Should I set the volume to zero?

> Obviously!!

<br>

I pressed pressed the button twice after it had reached 0, so.. it must be at -2 now!

> We could as well roll blanks while it's playing?

You see when we pass the neighbour's roses and smell them just to realise they no longer smell because we weren't the first ones with this brilliant idea, I wonder if there is a way we could get the taste out of the food.

> The taste out of food?!<br>
> Isn't it called death when the body leaves the soul?

...

> ...

...

> I am joking!!

...

> I said I was joking.
It's like removing the wetness from water, cold from snow. it's emergent. so you can't. but you can change it, or change its environment.
your premise could be misleading also because a flower deliberatly produce  scent and we may just happen to pass when this effort has run its course.

...<br>
umph

> What now.

nothing.

> yes, long explanation to cover up the bad joke.

EYE didn't say anything!!!

> yeah but why are you acting as if dead is not a change of stasis in which  matter gets lost in translation? Maybe there is no scent without the flower but can't we only judge as far as we can experience? Maybe flower are like that because insects are watching, and scent is secondary, and pollination a necessity. Maybe the goal is not whether food tastes good or bad but if it passes the nutrients exam.

...

> I was seriously joking!

Your joke was wrong.

> See!

I didn't say my counter-argument will be right either, so don't get hyped up.<br>

Taking the sent out of the flower, or the taste out of the food has nothing to do with a soul leaving the body; whatever the soul means, or be called death, but rather, life.<br>
It seems like the sent and the taste are like the ride, when you have a car and a driver.<br>
If the rider is gone, it doesn't necesseraly mean the car is broken, but it's the ride that's gone.

> ...

You were also too quick to call the sent secondary and pollination primary. If this is seen as the journey and the destination, in case of life, doesn't this make the destination of living death? and if so, why isn't everyone rushing to die?<br>
There are beautiful flowers that don't smell much, nor subjectively pleasant, there are good looking foods, that aren't healthy nor appetising, the same can be said for beautiful cars that are high maintenance, and ridden occasionally, but also bodies that are prim, with a life that's empty.

> ...<br>
> It makes sence, but doesn't make any sense also at the same time.<br><br>
In case of life being the ride and death the destination, first, further transformation occur to the body after death. THis means, death is not the end for the body either, but a final stop for life.<br>
Second, when you are living, some people find it bearable to have a goal in life, just like when you are riding, a destination in mind. But this contradicts the mere fact of riding, if it's seen as living, because as you ride, you are at a destination everywhere you are, and as you live, it doesn't neceserily mean that your body is dead every second of your life.


...<br>
When you live you can't be dead every second of your life, because your heart no matter how fast or slow it may be beating, if you are alive, it never stops beating. So in a way, you are not dead every second of your life, but somewhere in a unique state of your life?

> So is it a one-way journey? to death?

...<br>
I don't know.

> If you tried to make the ride;life what you want it to be, you would be in the way of letting it be what it could be. Still despise the contradiction, questions like where do you see yourself in N years still exist, when in reality, being where you want to be in 5 years would require you to know the microstates of all the particles in the universe and all living entities, inside and outside your control to carve your way through. Even the weather cannot be forecast 1 month ahead with accuracy, let alone 5 years of all the particles in the universe, including the weather and all dynamic systems in it.

...<br>
You would also need to consider all the infinite ways in which each intent could be realised.

> No, you wouln't. Unless free will is real.

Oh yeah, I see, you already have the state of all the particles in the universe at a point. I assume including yourself?

> I think so?

Oh no, how about the technological realm. do particles in the universe dictate what the person will be searching on their phone, or even more complicated what they will be getting?

> uh.. I don't know. I didn't think about it.

I have an idea. but a top down one?!

Maybe the goals in life like the destination of the ride should be consideraded as part of the environment, as opposed of the car or the rider?<br>
Going at point X and arriving at point X are states of mind, they are not real. Being at point X is real, and depends on all other particles in the universe.

> So it seems at each point you can either be living in your head or in the world?

Yes and no. You are always present in the world, but see the reality being experienced as where you focus your attention. If it's in your head, Then maybe you are "living" in your head, or anywhere around your environmemt.<br>

> ...

Imagine me and you were going on a hike at night, and we both had torches. let's say they are normal torches that can only point within a radius of 10 meters. Let say we were also having a conversation while on this hike and we are chatting while pointing our torches where we are going. Then suddenly instead of pointing ahead, I turn the focus of the light to point to your face. When you finish speaking, you feel irritated, so you keep twitching your eyelids until your sight adapts again. We continue, then, instead of pointing forward again, I take the spotlight to my face, suddenly you stop looking forward and follow my light.<br>

This continuing and the focus keep going away from the environment, to face to face, to face to face. Eventually, we no longer know where we are with accuracy, eventually, we didn't pay attention to the last 500 meters because we were focusing on blinding our sights.

See that at any given time this light can only focus on one view at a time?

> ...

I see it like a conversation, too. When we are talking about a subject and the subject only the whole time, it's like we are pointing our torches forwards the whole time; analysing our discussion watch it develop.<br>
When instead of focusing on the subject I give my personal opinion, it's as if I was asking you to point your torch on my face. if I did it myself, it could be seen as being defensive; running away from the object of discussion by directing opinions on myself. And if I pointed it on yours, it'd be as if I was being subjective, as suddenly the conversation itself doesn't matter as much as what you think instead. At that point you may add an obstacle ahead of the hike, it may be a bridge. but in both case, the conversation is no longer just what it was; objective.

> ...It sounds like in the world we live in, roads and things man made are our opinions thrown here and there. And if that's the case, then we don't live in what the world is, we live in what the world could be.

I chose a hike instead of a walk for the same reason. I should have specified a hike on an off-beated trail, where those hiking have no intention to change the plot, but enjoy the existing story.<br><br>

> If it's a story, it seems to be one that will never end.

Tht's why having a goal is like expecting the life in your head to be the one you are enjoying instead of the actual one unfolding before your eyes.
I guess the beauty in a book, it unfolds like a trajectory braided by each word leading to the next, like footsteps behind your leg become the present then the past, then the present, then the past again, then the present then the past, but reaches every house with their messages like a postman.

On the hike, like in life, there are those who use lasers instead of torches to focus on the destination but lose the way around, and there are those who use torches to focus on the way around but lose the focus ahead. <br>
Sometimes when you get irritated that the cycing in front of you double crossed you, I used to want to revenge, so I pointed my laser ahead. But I figured I couldn't, cause I had missed the bottle in front of me, causing him to space out even further.<br> But when I realised I couln't double cross back until I double crossed myself, I took the torch and trew away the laser, double crossed myself everytime, and when I looked ahead, the wind was always there?<br><br>

> But weren't you lucky to have both the laser and the torch? How could you, if you only have one story, one focus at a time, one life? 

If you only have one life, like you can only have one light, when you get lost in the wild, if you use a laser, those who are coming to rescue you will search for you at where it's pointing. But it might not be where you are, just yet.

If you are a torch, pointing to somebody else, they might find them first, but they might not be the one that's lost. If you point it on your face, you will be found, but it will be your fault that you were lost. And if you point it ahead of your way, other may share the ride, come and walk by your side. 

> Can you pair up with somebody with a laser if you are a torch?

Add water and an extra staw to my whiskey? Erm, why waste water? Why disrespect the whisky? Why have wiskey with water when you can have whiskey, and water?

> But whiskey with water is less strong and makes you drunk slowly.

Why not just drink whiskey slowly and drink water when you are thirsty? The smell also gets affected, and you get to put a twisted expression after each subsequent sip, whyyyy? just whyyyy?

> I don't think that's how it works. When you mix them you don't get a bad whiskey or a bad water, but each drop of each changing each drop of the other forming a new drink.<br>
Furthermore, they cannot be compared, they can only be exchanged.<br>
You don't get a darker white and a lighter black from mixing black and white, <br>
You get a colour in its own right.<br><br>
As per whiskey with water, maybe you might like it that way, too? 

No thanks. I just like water when I drink water, and

> And don't you just like the leaf when you drink tea?

...

> I am joking!<br>
> But either way you are not safe from being lost, or from people?! 

uhmp.. only those who are lost can be found, and not all people count as people.

> ?!

If you are on a ride for example, and your destination is the sunset, you are different from somebody riding to their house. The sunset can find you everywhere, your house is only somewhere.<br>

People you meet at the sunset don't count as people but as backgrounds to the sunset, and to them, so do you, whereas if you go home and somebody is missing for no reason, you may start panicking for whatever reason.

> Either the center or the tengent of the circle again!

yes... While to a free ranger, a goal may be a contradiction, to a marine botanist, the rooftop of a this building wasn't underwater a million years ago.

While the beauty of the free ranger is that they may never need their torch, or may have lost their lasers since they don't search for what they need, it finds them, 

this beauty is also a curse, cause if they were in a football game, they'd be the goal keeper.

> I am losing the focus of the conversation. Or I just don't understand it anymore. My torch is becoming a bad mirror, I guess?

Or your laser became a low battery icon?<br><br>
What don't you understand? Not that any of this is absolute, or even makes sense at best.

> We now have torches, lasers, souls, batteries, tengents, football games, marine botanits, sunsets, subjectives, defensive conversations, getting lost, being found, flowers, life, death, pollination, drivers and seats and what not? WHaT aRe We EVEN talking about?!

It's drivers and cars, not drivers and seats..

> See I don't even know anymore!<br>
> Even the rain is getting bored of our conversation.

If it "stopped" doesn't that mean the opposite? As in stopping your ride to get an ice cream? Cause have you ever stopped in the middle of a ride because you are bored?

> uhm.., if the body is just a car, and living is the ride, how many seats does yours have?

...,<br>
interesting!<br>
I don't know..<br>
How could I know?<br>
With people and things that come and go,..<br>
Maybe I am not even a car, maybe I am traaaain?

> If you are a train, then I am the railway.

...

> ...

What if I am an airplane then?

> If you are an airplane, then..<br>
Then I am the ground.<br><br>
Yeah, you cannot be flying forever, you must land somewhere on the ground sooner or later. Every time you take off, you have to take off from me, and every time you land it's also on me, and if you crash, you will also be crashing on me.<br>
The ground is also better because if I say I will be the sky, you may automatically choose to be a millipede and start wondering how they cordinate all those legs, and if I am earth then, I will either be holding the roots of plants and the trees they walk on or the soil they tickle or catch them when they fall.<br>
The ground is also better in case you want to be a boat and never touch the ground, but even if you won't touch the ground, I would still hold your anchor and if you sink, I will still meet you at the bottom of the ocean. 
And if y-

Wow!

> I am joking!<br>I am joking!

Wow wow wow,<br> 
Then I guess I should be glad being just me.

> Then I

Hein, then what?

> I'd still be the ground.

... why on earth would you be the ground now? 

> cause, life is too short?

Oh my goooshhhh

> I am joking!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I meant to say, you would look down on me, but I'd still hold your ground?

..what a cheesy coverup.

> I'd still feed the cattle

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA shut upppppppppp!!!!

Did you know that a female cat is called a queen and a male cat is called a bitch?

> Nope..<br>
> Does that make a male cat a king? how is a male dog called?

..A **troll** would make more sense!

> ..<br><br>
> You are so mean!<br>Why do you have to call my dog a troll after I've just called a male cat a king?

You don't have a dog.<br><br>

> You are right.. I-only-have-a-queeeeeeen.

...<br>
Since when?

> Since.. N-

AAAAAAAA.. Lea-Leave me aloooone!!!!

I am not a queen, and a female cat doesn't make the male cat king!

> But if you were a queen, I woul..

I am never being. 

> But if you were?!!<br>

You'd still be just you.

> Just me?<br><br>
What? Are you.. g-g--ay?

Grrrrrr!!!<BR>Why Don't you get it? Are you pretending, or what?

> ..?

I don't want to be a queen, and I don't see why anybody would ever want to be king.

But if you became a king, you'd stop being you, and I'd have to like a king; possibly become a queen, when I'd neither want to like a king, nor being a queen.

NO, I do not.

### End Credits roll (frtt)

While aiming to convert HTML to EPUB, 

![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_0.jpg)
I just wabted to know ~~what's the matter~~ the
![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_3.jpg)
![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_4.jpg)
![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_5.jpg)
And compare it with other
![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_6.jpg)
So that I could figure if..
![what's the matter?](/public/assets/images/matter_7.png)



#### I figured out that HTML is all I ever needed! Phew..<br><br>
![very fast book](/public/assets/images/fast_book.png)

## Post-Credit Scenes
My favourite thing about coding is:
![would rather](/public/assets/images/would_rather.png)
And that's why this project was awesome!

> Because not only GNU is Not Unix, the cursor at the end of the list stopped because, apart from Finding, Designing, Testing and Writting, my other favourite thing about coding is: **Reading**!

But not only epub is bandwith heavier than HTML, there was one aspect of FastBook which I overL👀ked.

**Instead of keeping each video book in ibooks, why not request it again?**👀

Similar to cooking, versus watching a cooking show, I personaly find reading and ruminating more enthralling than watching and forgetting.

So with that in mind on how to use FastBook, this is how to ~~cook a book~~ boil as part of the ingredients.<br><br>

**1) Turn off the oven**

![where?](/public/assets/images/light.JPG)

To toggle the dark ~~mode~~ side, press the moon.

Can I at least have the monlight?

> Do you wanna go premium?

No.

> With a 1 month free trial?

Noo.

> 3 month free trial?

Nooo. omg, leave me alone!

> But premium is also free.

Huā?



<br>
**2) Touch the flame**

1. Too far
![out_of_sight](/public/assets/images/too_far.png)
2. Too close
![too close](/public/assets/images/so_close.png)

**3) I think it's TIME...to** ~~delete all the code and start all over again~~ **ASK WHAT TIME IT IS!**
![pascal](/public/assets/images/time.png)

The time icon toggles the time. (pretty self-explanatory). When you clicked on the timestamps toggled, what happened?

**5) Veni Vedi Vici**

> Just like the cover of this boiling pot, I get very annoyed when there is too much water in my soup.

![fork](/public/assets/images/fork.png)
That's why I designed this "fork" to "scoope" out the important ~~giga~~**bits**.

But in form of an arrow. Cause **I like when content "goes to the point"** ~~of the fork or?~~.

Ah the sky! so blue.. Namely the title, and everything else highlighted in that colour will have the luxury to be jumped to when you hit the target. <<this text should also be highlighted in sky blue. `TODO: do it..`<br>

You tried it? ~~and it didn't work on your computer?~~<br>

Congratulations, you successfully skipped to parts that were likely to be suitable starts. (which were also computed without you noticing --yay).

This is for all the intros out there, to which, unless your name starts with "R" and your surname is "Sapolsky", I just don't want to know if you have been absent ~~minded~~.<br>
I was never ~~settling on settling~~ following. I was just passing.

To find these starts, I am reusing backends from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that I worked on in the past to cut down the bushes, so there be no more beatings around bushes?
```TODO: now that I think about it: scaling it to every page I visit?```

**6) No, no, it's not the small talks.. I just find it hard to engage in conversations when Pascal is not around.**

Who is Pascal?

> Yes.

## Reading tips? haha

I can't be the only one who hates it when rereading a book, they find themselves removing highlights made by their past selves. That spoiler!

If I hadn't find a new hobby with the highlight feature, I could have removed it all together even.
**The solution to this is self-evident. <u>Leave the book clean for the next reader.</u>**

Another thing I personally noticed when highlighting was that my brain would start taking the highlighted information for granted and stop pondering about them because it'd now seem as if it had them on demand.<br><br>
Information measured is not worth evolving. No wonder the double slit experiment.

Obviously this, is as dangerous as taking pictures on a trip or a walk, because the reading itself, just like the moment itself is the actual take away.
Even the Uncertainty principle could back this up!

If there is anything worth remunating about, to the brain, if the process of reading is being interupted, this whole reading may becomes the equivalence of drinking water when brushing teeth. ~~If you brush your teeth at all.~~<br>

Sometimes, some people read comments and review before reading a book they want to read. How is this any different from taking a picture of a meal before tasting it?
Don't you know that anticipating a reward raises your dopamine level and makes you unable to enjoy the book or whatever process it is to the initial level?
Think about it, do you think being hyped beforehand turns the graph of your enjoyement into an exponential growth or an exponential decay one?

Why do you think social medias and those games are addictive? Do you ever match the same reward level you started with, or it's your hope to reach it again that keeps you up, like in Zeno's paradox of motion ~~or flirting~~?! How do you think gambling works?

If climbing a mountain and reaching the top is more rewarding than going down and reaching the bottom, why are you going down in hope to get to the top? ~~says someone sitting at their desk starring at the drizzle but thinking of going to the beach, nonetheless.~~

This is when taking notes afterwards, preferably after a pause (cause I think the brain needs time to package this information and you may forget it faster if you don't give it the time to store it properly. It might seem counter unintuitive in this high paced world we live in nowadays to still be listening to yourself by the time you finish saying those 4 letters; "wait", but every process needs time and if you can't rush a boiling kettle to ..., why are you rushing your brain to store cold memories? don't you know they will be even colder when you retrieve them?)

Another way to reinforce the storage is adding ember to it, every once in a while, they say you need to reference it, is it 20 times? Anyways, sometimes I just use the information in other settings. This way, it gets more opportunities to be remembered.
See it as having a worm bin and a garden separatly, or having a wormbin feed into a garden directly.
Now I have interest to keep the bin up to date, because other things depends on it; moving it from something available, to something indispensable.

Cause 20 times,lol, who hit their head to abide to facts like that?
Don't you know that if your brain knows it's doing something it does it worse than if it never knew in the first place? What do you think is the hardest part in acting natural? Is it the acting? or the natural? is it me? or those aren't meant to ever be in the same sentence?<br>


Good luck acting natural now!<br>


If using this on MacOS/Ios, with the Web format, there is a way to markup the page. This automatically converts it into a Pdf file, also.<br>For epub, there is a built-in note feature in iBooks. I have absolutly no information on how this project works or displays on any other operating system, ~~and I couldn't be bothered.~~

But this might not be necessary if notes are:
- saved separatly, as a reflections, (which is "better"? imho?, like eating from your plate instead of eating from a pot? at a party? _yikes, do you know no shame?_ ~~GIVE ME THE POT!! _come baaack, I will give you my_ pl..~~)
- used directly in other applications or analysis from alien settings. e.g. If reading about worms then hyphae, what's the contrast between them? Maybe apply this in another unrelated field? Maybe, instead.. No, Maybe.. oh, maybe playing with legos is just fun in itself? Don't you aggree?<br>

Yes?<br>
No?<br>
Definitely?<br>
Naturally?<br>
"Naterally wicous"?


But that's just me..<br>
Tell me what you do at.. oh, there is no way to tell me.<br>

Anyway, I am bored now.<br>
Go find out what the other things do, ~~if you want.~~
