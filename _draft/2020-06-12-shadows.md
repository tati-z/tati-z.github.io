title: shadows â€” when higher dimensions fall short.
---

`20:19` For reasons completely unrealted, I look down at my desk in search for answers inside my heads. There must have been something in long waves, too exclusive to make this light, the only light illuminating my toughts. Maybe.<br>
Or maybe, looking at how a source became everything it met, leaving on sides it couln't reach, shadows, too beautiful and shady to overlook, was all just a state of mind, a mind looking back on books read beforehand, while stuck in a play next, now playing on repeat.<br><br>

Like a bean germinating, it will be long before a light shyly raising out of its grave elongates the shadows. But it won't be long before I start to  wonder: in just how many ways.

I have never worked with 3D to find the other ways.<br>
If I try, try bending the laws of optics and mathematics, will I find a way to simulate 3D outcomes with 2D ways?

Why is it not enough to just look at it all night long, use my hands to move the light around, imagine the angles of incidence that could meet my sight as if by happenstance?

I want to close my eyes.<br>
Not because I followed a light that left me in the shadows,<br>
Not to become blind so I can't tell if I am in the shadows,<br>

But because,<br>
To see this light like I am seeing it, it must have been caught inside my eyes.
