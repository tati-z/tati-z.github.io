A bird of unknown origin that spends most of its time on the streets.

It believes streetlights should be sensory instead of being left on all nihght because trees and other plants rely on the distribution of light accross seasons to optimise their energy usage and regulate themselves. Street lights also gets in the way of nocturnal animal that rely on darkness to hunt.

So either humans belong in the forest or trees belong in the forest where they have access to the fungi network anyway (and humans stop destroying their habitats), or we cohabit and keep the lights off and stop planting trees in isolation, and humans add extra nutrients to the soil and organise extra waterings, but also leave food outside to feed all nightlife that now struggles. 

Unless humans like the sun off during the day, unless they'd like living miles away from one another for their entire lives, or unless they like their bedroom lights on for decoration, **then it shouldn't be too hard to see that what they are doing isn't pretty.**
