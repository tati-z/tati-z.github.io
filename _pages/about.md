That doesn't know where that person has been.<br>Th**I**s person shouldn't be where they are.

But since they are here maybe they want to see something that lasts forever?

Oh.. they want to see your recent photographs!

That's it stalker. Now you should be able to spell her surname.<br>

Hey, hey... close the door behind yourself.<br>
And don't come back.


Tan tan tan taaaaann
_tan tan tan tannnnnn_
tan tan tan taaaaannnnn
ta ran ran ran rannn ta^ ran ran..

There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road

And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode

Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue

Beckoning, the great divide

Ask no questions, take no side

Who's to say who's right or wrong

Whose course is braver run

All I know is all we had, is oversaid than done

Tan tan tan raan...

# Sing with me..

Friends never say goodbyyyyyye...
