title: MINImize â€” when less is more; more or less.

Inspired by [wuukasch](https://society6.com/product/silhouette1764749_print?sku=s6-10224347p4a1v45) and [quibe](https://society6.com/product/back-line-z1o_print)'s work, I wanted to see more of these works, especially: those they haven't worked on yet.

I know you would probably just get an account with those websites where people follow people and wait on callbacks, but that wouln't work for me, because what I really want is images I look at be minimized everytime I feel like it.

25/05/20 : 18:17: I am not sure about the 'minimized' in *'everytime I feel like it'*, but I know that if I find myself staring at one for even five seconds, that'll be enough to break a record in a AD-Ded-brain catalog.

<br>

> So why don't we stare and see who blinks first?

You mean go on an adventure and see where it leads?<br>

> We know where we want to end, so that'll be a good way to start.

I know I will need an edge detection algorithm and I know [I can trust you not to jump to the conclusions](/public/assets/images/to_the_conclusion.png).<br>

> I know that simple is hard, and I know you won't settle for noise is art.

<br>
### Zeroth try

The usual way would be using something like [Canny Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector), but it uses gradients to detect these edges in the first place, so let's take [the gradient route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient) at root.

Converting to greyscale, then applying a [Sobel filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) with a kernel of size 5x5; erm..

![kernel = 5x5](/public/assets/images/minimize_0_try.png)

Off the bat we need to go kernel sizes lower.<br>

> Off the bat the result is struggling to hold the light within.

That's because the differenciation in opacity from the algorithm used in the Sobel filter is being detected over a larger space; `5x5` as the kernel convolves over the image.

![convolution](/public/assets/images/minimize_first_try_why.png)

> Are we talking about the same thing?!

### First try
Reducing the size of the kernel from a `5x5` to `3x3` and down to `1x1`:
![kernel = 3x3](/public/assets/images/minimize_1_try.png)

You are probably thinking what I am thinking: these don't look like the ones we were inspired by.

> I don't know if we should be having **'look like'** and **'inspired'** in the same sentence: <br>
> _I stared at the `1x1` for more than 3 seconds_ ðŸ™ˆ..

I'd say the one in the middle looks kinda like it, but maybe it's the high contrast in the eyes that's defying gravity for you.<br>

Let's see how they look like inverted..

![inverted](/public/assets/images/minimize_1_try_inverted.png)

Okay, no.<br>
> But.. we are exploring, no?

If we were having a conversion, this result would be off topic.

> No, if we were having a conversation, that conversation would be off topic. <br>

### Second try

To get rid of the bavels, we could apply a threashold of on the magnitude of the image i.e. add the horizontal gradient also, then ignore everything above a certain shade of grey?<br>


![all gradients](/public/assets/images/all_gradients.png)
![all gradients inverted](/public/assets/images/all_gradients_inverted.png)

> I kinda like the bavel effect though.. It reminds me of the relief carvings in the Egyptian section of The Louvre.. <br>
> And the bright eyes, of some creepy scuptules I forgot the name of that are in the Archeological Museum of Napoly..<br>

![just like](/public/assets/images/just_like.png)

Wow, those looks nothing like my results.

> See, this "goal-oriented" nature of yours is why I don't like going on adventures with you. Who knows! Bringing the thought on the bevels further, we might meet different sort of things..

I am definitly not the bad guy here.

> oh my days..

The adventure is for is line arts, but now you want something with an extra coordinate to them.

> I honestly think the bavels on white are creating a better effect than the lines are after.
> It literally looks like the white on white stroke from [Hello It's Charlie](http://helloitscharlie.com/minimalthinking).

![white on white?](/public/assets/images/white_on_white.png)

(scratches forehaed in annoyance.)

> [People are using real spray](https://www.behance.net/gallery/54289537/Unicolor-Mockup-Pack) to get this sort of result.<br>

Okay fiiine.

You are making this much of a big deal than it is. We'll keep the bavels. But I need to go check something out.

> Can I come?<br>

No.

> ...

OKAY FIIIIIIINE.<br>

I was going to use adaptative threasholding. and if I said yes,<br>
I.. I was going to ask you to keep your mouth shut about it!

> ..Would you mean it?

Do you want me to tell the truth or do you want me to lie.<br>

> I want you to live the truth so you can stop lying to yourself.<br>

...

If I ignore values over a certain shade of grey, or shade of black, shade of white, call it however you like. This is what we will get:

![converted](/public/assets/images/converted.png)

And when comparing this to the bavels, we get that.
![Line art versus bavel](/public/assets/images/line_vs_bavel.png)

So, what do you say?

> I like the result, but we both know how many questions we are burning to ask.

Yeah..<br>

1/ I am loosing edges. And though I like the open look because it look like quibe's work, elsewhere, I am still losing edges.

![loosing noisy](/public/assets/images/loosing_edges.png)

> I like the losing edge effect ðŸ™ˆ

There are also some noise around the generated image.

> 2/ The image used previously was fairly noise-free. This is not working on images like:

![too noisy](/public/assets/images/noise.png)

![too noisy](/public/assets/images/noise_noise_noise.png)

> I like the effect of being stuck in a wall though..<br>
> _I think I starred at rightmost for 4 seconds ðŸ™ˆ_

This is an interesting problem. The image used was easier for the algorithm to work effortlessly on similar image without loosing details. To get other images to be like this involves using smoothing algorithms that invole averaging surranding colors while aiming to keep the edges sharp.

Making this a chicken and egg problem type when what we actually want is hatching eggs with feathers topping.

>...<br>

...

> ..So we basically want.. what??

...

Do you remember [that](https://youtu.be/Y0Oa4Lp5fLE) behavioural biology lecture in which they mentioned that **sometimes a chicken is an egg's way of making other eggs**?

> Yeah haha.. imagine!

> Then could wars be peace's way of making other peaces? Problems solution's way of making other solutions?

Or the other way around.. peace as war's way of making other wars. and solutions problem's ways of making others problems.

> Parents as babies' way of making other babies, life as death's way of making other deaths, living organism as virus' way of making other virus. And-

And- we are not going to find out which law of Dialectical Materialism they fall into.

> INTERPENETRATION OF OPPOSITES!! easy :)

Wow, did you pull that off a hat?<br>
What's wrong with Negation of the Negation?

> Yes.

Very funny!<br>

Okay. We were talking about..?<br>

Yes: To have sharp edges you need smoothing. But smoothing blurs out the whole image including edges while we want both. One quick way to achieve this result would be to apply smoothing and adding the edges back gradually, as doing it all in one go would give very thick edges and this is not be the desired result. Bilateral Filtering that most photo editors use to address this is also slow compared to smoothings like [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur).

3/ The thinckness of the stroke is also far from uniform. There are thinings that can be accomplished using [morphological transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2514.pdf), but the result is far from the smooth lines like the images we were inspired by. In fact, thinning could help in preparing steps that would involve tracing the contour to sample points that could be used in fitting a spline for example, such the Lanczos [Interpollation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1854146/what-is-the-idea-behind-scaling-an-image-using-lanczos) for the contours and [Multivariate interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_interpolation) for textures.


### Third try

Implementation of the Sobel filter that does not automatically convert the negative slopes when going from a very high intensity like 255 to a very low one, when mutiplying the vectors it uses with the pixels in the images, these negative values get truncated to 0 when converting color values that unsigned ints of 8 bits each (1 bytes: 0-255, 256 values total) gets to discard these values that are < 0.

To remove the noises in images like the one below, I need something that doesn't remove them per say because that's harder than making them invisible. 

![other](/public/assets/images/33.png)

The way that photo editors make these go away is the same that people who draw make them go away. 

People who draw [smudge the paper](http://sometalkaboutart.blogspot.com/2012/03/smudging-and-blending-with-charcoal.html) to make the noise invisible as they draw and so do photo-editing softwares with their [smughe tools](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-tool-smudge.html) and [oil paint filters](https://dribbble.com/shots/4927742-Oil-paint-effect).<br>

`I am not going to implement any of it. `**`I lost interest.`**

> Just like that?!

07/06/20 : 02:20: Even if I can now run a server on localhost and ship image URLs to it when I end doing [what I am doing](/public/assets/images/knot_now.JPG), I still don't like that I was seeing noise even after applying morphological transformations.<br>

> I don't mind noises/imperfections. They keep people like you up all night and I don't like sleeping early.

I'd like to sleep early..<br>

> Then I hate the paths once travelled because the paths least travelled always fix our problems.

####Â Next (could've been)steps:

- Implement the smudge tool or the oil paint filter from [this paper](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/xjobb/BrushPaintingAlgorithms.pdf), to smooth out the resulted pixels, or research on how Raster to Vector conversion works<br>
- **Some Image Sources: could you please sue me with your name/link so I add the credits?**<br>
- Use the Kmean-nearest neighbour algorith to limit the number of colours in the image if some colors would be prefered instead of all blank and bold. 

> I don't care about colors.

I don't care about you.

<br><br><br>

> ..then why did you keep staring at me after 5 seconds?

Do you want the mathematical truth or the psychological lie.

<br><br>

> The psychological truth.

It states that when you look at someone for over 5 seconds it means you care about them.

> I want the mathematical lie?

Then why chose the pychological lie?

> Would you play a game in which you were bound to losing?

Would you change the rules of a game after you realise you've lost?

<br>
> I know what you are gonna say: **it's not fun if it's not fair**.

I wasn't going to say that.

> Yeah, says that all the time.

If a game was fair but the expertise between the players was vast. Would you consider that a fair play?

> ..<br>
> Do the players know they have that a gap in expertise?

The play-..<br>
That's a good question.. or rather consideration. Changes everything!

I never consi- forget I asked the question.

> In the case where they do know. How are they defining winning?<br>

..Forget. I asked. the question.


> ...<br>
> But if you played a game in which the only way for you to not lose was for the other person to win. Would you play that game?


If the mathematical thruth is what you are still after, you can always ask again,<br>explicitly.

> ...

..Just because I look at you for over 5 seconds, doesn't mean I care about you mathematically speaking, 

because the probability that somebody cares about you given they looked at you for over 5 second is not the same as the probability that they look at you for over 5 seconds given they care about you.
<br><br><br>

> Do you care about me?

We agreed to not answering a question provided you had jumped to conclusions.

> But that was like.. ten years ago??!

Four years.<br>
With exactly two months, zero weeks, six days, twenty four, minus sixteen hours.

<br><br>

> How high do you think is the probability that somebody stops talking to you given they care about you?
