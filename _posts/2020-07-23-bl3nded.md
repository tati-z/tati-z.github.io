title: bl3nded â€” when coase salt loses its rough edges.

[In an article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/playing-the-tin-sandwich-a-primer-on-the-harmonica/) about the Harmonica, they had said it all, and even thaught me things I immediatly ignored.<br>
But I had a very serious question that they did not cover. **How the hell did they find out about the time where I refused to implement the smudge tool?**

Results from [MINImize](https://www.tatianazihindula.com/2020/05/25/minimize.html) that will benefit from this smoothing are of type:

The **[reference paper I will be using](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/xjobb/BrushPaintingAlgorithms.pdf)** has what I need in the smudge and oil paint filters sections. But after a close read, this a l o n e will not be ~~enough~~ unless the filter is used interractively; with the user dictating the direction of the smudge.

**I, on the other hand have 0 time to fuss around.** I want it to just: work.<br>
I want it just work similar to the result below from an iMessage filter where you simply take a picture, then click on the filter,

and magic happens.

## The Start

It's already a given that I will work with edges and features separately, but atop of that, these are the extras I think I will need for now:

1. Follow the directions of the edges inside the image when softening them.
For this I think I could use the edge detection kernel I used in MINImize; the Sorbel Filter, since it gives me the 180 and 90 degree edges.. I might need others.. 

2. I am curious to see how the line arts from MINImize will look when smoothed.

3. I don't think, at least for now, that I am a big fan of the sharp edges between colours in the iMessage version, so I think I might be going for the Harmonica version?
