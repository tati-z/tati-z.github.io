title: ly. â€” a lie that crawls like a spider but reads like a song.

Instead of interupting my worflow to quickly look up the lyrics to songs and get distracted, **ly** fetches these captions from the internet and brings them to my terminal instead.

### Demo

```bash
coming soon (after the exams)
```
<asciinema-player src="/public/assets/ly.cast"></asciinema-player>
<script src="/asciinema-player.js"></script>

### Get it

Windows users, I am sure there is an equivalent.

For Unix, append this to your .bash_profile, .alias, or .bashrc, then source it.

```bash
coming soon (after the exams)
```
