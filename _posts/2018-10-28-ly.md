title: ly — a lie that crawls like a spider but reads like a song.
---

Instead of interupting my worflow to look up lyrics of songs and get distracted, **ly** fetches these lyrics off the internet for me and brings them to my terminal instead.

### Demo

<asciinema-player src="/public/assets/videos/ly.cast" theme="solarized-dark" poster="npt:7:28" font-size="14px" speed="2x" rows="21" idle-time-limit="2" loop></asciinema-player>
<script src="/public/assets/js/asciinema-player.js"></script>

### Is this.. a lie?
```bash
no
```

### Get it

```bash

```

### So it IS a lie!
```bash
yes
```
> Did it.. lie when it claimed to teach me new languages? <(ツ)_/¯
