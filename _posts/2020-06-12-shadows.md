title: shadows â€” when higher dimensions fall short.
---

12/06 20:19 For reasons completely unrealted, I look down at my desk in search for answers inside my heads. There must have been something in long waves, too exclusive to make this light, the only light illuminating my toughts. Maybe.<br>
Or maybe, looking at how a source became everything it met, leaving on sides it couln't reach, shadows, too beautiful and shady to overlook, was all just a state of mind, a mind looking back on books read beforehand while stuck in a play next, now playing on repeat.<br><br>

It will be long before a light shyly raising out of its grave like a seed germinating reshapes the shadows. But it won't be long before I start to  wonder: in just how many ways.

I haven't worked with 3D before to find the other ways.<br>
If I try, try bending the laws of optics and mathematics, will I find a way to simulate 3D outcomes with 2D ways?

Why is it not enough to just look at it all night long, use my hands to move the light around, imagine the angles of incidence that could meet my sight as if by happenstance?

I want to close my eyes, and fall asleep.<br>
Not because a light overshadowed the answers I sought,<br><br>

But because to see it like I am seeing it, it must have been caught inside my eyes.
