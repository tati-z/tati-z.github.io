title: when feelings speak - they probably don't speak Japanese.

23:00
So remember when I said about 40 minutes ago _“...but who knows what else I will find in this totally unrelated video?”_
Well, there was nothing more interesting I found in that one but look what I found in this other one?!

23:03 This is the moment where I am very tempted to learn japanese but if there is a translation of this book, I want an audio book version of it cause: obviously!
<br>Even if I owned a DVD player -- how loud would sound be if I read it?! I doubt the disks come in Vinyl; (whose player I also don't own).

23:10 I don’t know why I am still watching this. **[I don’t even](/public/assets/images/do_you_even.png)** play an electric guitar. Furthermore, why is he saying that this book talks about "sections"? How many sections does one need to hear and feel?! Is teaching toddlers to ear and feel using "sections" a thing now?? This sounds off (no pun intended). **But it’s not as if moving to Japan on a whim wasn't an illogi-**

Was that book going to be what buying a wrap in hope to find a present inside read like?!

This is what I would still be looking for after I would have learnt all the Japanese just to make sense of what that "earing and feeling", (and of course: read the original versions of those Tankas), **but this is it:** the flame that keeps Yufuin Onsen hot in the middle of winter.

**When they say silence is loud, this is what I will be hearing from now.**

It would be an insult to _**~~compare it~~**_ to [**my first layered piece**](/misk_audio) that "I made up" this afternoon, so I won't do that.

However, **I should just be ready..** just in case they came back and said, _you only have 1 minute and 27 seconds left to live_.
