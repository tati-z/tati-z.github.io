title: when feelings speak - they don't speak Japanese.

23:00
So remember when I said about 40 minutes ago _“...but who knows what else I will find in this totally unrelated video?”_
Well, there was nothing more interesting I found in that one but look what I found in this other one?!

23:03 This is the moment where I am very tempted to learn japanese but if there is a translation of this book, I want an audio book version of it cause: obviously!
<br>Even if I owned a DVD player -- how loud would sound be if I read it?! I doubt the disks come in Vinyl; (which I also don't own).

23:10 I don’t know why I am still watching this. I don’t even play electric guitars. Furthermore, why is he saying that this book talks about "techniques"? How many techniques does one need to hear and feel?! So, teaching toddlers to ear and feel using "techniques" is a thing now?. This sounds off.., **but it’s not as if moving to japan on a whim wasn't an illog-**

Was that book going to be what buying a wrap in hope to find a present inside read like?!

This is what I would still be looking for after I would have learnt all the Japanese just to make sense of what that "earing and feeling", (and of course: read the original versions of those Tankas), but this is it: the flame that keeps Yufuin Onsen hot in the middle of winter.

**When they say silence is loud, this is what I will be hearing from now.**

It would be an insult to _"compare"_ it to [my first layered piece](/misk_audio) that "I made up" this afternoon, so I won't do that.
