*#Take 2*

If I remember ..., I wanted to convert videos into books before accidently deleting everything I had written up until OVeR hAlF Of THIS PAGE -angry face-!

The reason I wanted to convert videos into books

- had space filling curves in it,
- lied on the projection from a Real plane to a Complex plane,
- mentioned degrees of neural connectivity and neuroplasticity,
- but also multidimentional thinking?
-    
-   
- guess we'll never know. Moving on...

It's **~~sensory overload!~~**

> Shut up!

# RAW data//
Okay after unpacking the RAW data, and singling out what I need, 
I don't care about the escaped quotes because: *regexp.*

What I didn't know though, was that there were new lines, reading between the lines. 
![dirty](/public/assets/images/dirty1.png)

This explains why lines in the earliest versions of this attempt never went past half of the screen.

![old version](/public/assets/images/old_attempt.png)

I liked this version a lot. It was CLI- based, and worked well. BUT. I HAD TO BE (OR NOT TO BE) On my~~**?**~~ "lap" "top".

With future versions, I want each line to be associated with links to timestamps, or maybe every 5 lines or so? so that I can jump to the point in the video if I decide: **I feel like it.**

# In the end,

~~Someday I may implement PDF format, if the need calls for it, but right now,~~
I am aiming for EPUB for its reflow feature that PDF doesn't know the smell of.

But also the ability to scan through a videos' content like... this:

![uuu](/public/assets/images/this.png)
So I can do...

thÃ¢t.


# And...what's in the middle?

![glass](/public/assets/images/qq.JPG)

The empty space between the `dd`s?
> Correct!

# Results

### Plot

OKAY, **it didn't happen.**<br>
Just as planned.<br>

![epub final](/public/assets/images/epub.png)

It ended up being: **better than expected**.

Did I just invent a new hobby?

The end.

I figured out that HTML is all I ever needed.<br><br>

### Post-Credit Scenes
My favourite thing about coding is:
![would rather](/public/assets/images/would_rather.png)
And that's why this project was awesome!

> Because not only GNU is Not Unix, the cursor at the end of the list stopped because, apart from Finding, Designing, and Writting, my other favourite thing is: **Reading**!

But not only epub is bandwith heavier than HTML, there was one aspect of FastBook which I overLðŸ‘€ked.

**Instead of keeping each video book in ibooks, why not request it again?**ðŸ‘€

Similar to cooking, versus watching a cooking show, I personaly find reading and ruminating more enthralling than watching and forgetting.

So with that in mind, this is how to ~~cook a book~~ boil as part of the ingredients.<br><br>

**1) Turn off the oven**

![where?](/public/assets/images/light.JPG)

To toggle the dark ~~mode~~ side, press the moon.
![moon](/public/assets/images/moon.png)

>> **The `*stars*` are sold separately.**

Can I at least have the monlight?

> Do you wanna go premium?

No.

> With a 1 month free trial?

Noo.

> 3 month free trial?

Nooo. omg, leave me alone!

> But premium is also free.

..Wha?

**2) Touch the flame**

1. Too far
![out_of_sight](/public/assets/images/too_far.png)
2. Too close
![too close](/public/assets/images/so_close.png)

**3) I think it's TIME...to** ~~delete all the code and start all over again~~ ~~serve Demeter~~ **ASK WHAT TIME IT IS!**
![pascal](/public/assets/images/time.png)

The time icon toggles the time. (pretty self-explanatory). Go click on the time to see what happens.

**5) Veni Vedi Vici**

> Just like the cover of this pot, I get very annoyed when there is too much water in my soup.

![fork](/public/assets/images/fork.png)
That's why I designed this "fork" to "scoope" out the important ~~giga~~**bits**.

But in form of an arrow. Cause **I like when content "goes to the point"**.

Ah the sky! so blue.. Namely the title, and everything else highlighted in that colour will have the luxury to be jumped to when you hit the target. <<this text should also be highlighted in sky blue. `TODO: do it..`

Congratulations, you have successfully skipped to parts that were likely to be suitable starts. (which were also computed without you noticing --yay).

This is for all the intros out there, in which, unless your name starts with "R" and your surname is "Sapolsky", I just don't want to know if you have been absent ~~minded~~.<br>
I was never following.

To find these starts, I used Natural Language Processing (NLP), in a project that I worked on in the past, which automated exactly that: skip the rambling in videos on YT.

**6) No, no, it's not the small talks.. I just find it hard to engage in conversations when Pascal is not around.**

> Who is Pascal?

Yes.

## Concepts

- Event Propagation
- iFrames
- CSS Properties
- Epub specification
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Finding ~~waldo~~ ~~wally~~ ~~nemo~~ p-p-p-pascal!
How come you can see my nose and I can't!<br><br>

Can you see my eyes, tðŸ‘€?<br>
No way!<br>
My forehead?..oh you have something _h**E**re_<br>

## Reading tips.

I can't be the only one who hates it when rereading a book, they find themselves removing highlights made by their past selves. That spoiler!

**The solution to this is self-evident. <u>Leave the book clean for the next reader.</u>**

Another thing I personally noticed when highlighting was that my brain would start taking the highlighted information for granted and stop pondering about them because it now thinks it has them on demand.<br><br>
As seen, this is dangerous because these parts are the actual take aways of the reading, and if there is anything worth remunating about, to the brain, this whole reading becomes the equivalence of drinking water when brushing your teeth. ~~If you brush your teeth at all.~~<br>

This is when taking notes, or using this information in another way comes in handy. If using this on MacOS/Ios, with the Web format, there is a way to markup the page. This automatically converts it into a Pdf file.<br>For epub, there is a built-in note feature in iBooks. I have no information on how this works/displays on any other operating system.
But this might not be necessary if notes are:
- saved separatly, as a reflections,
- used directly in applications by going through further analysis from other perspectives. e.g. When reading about worms and hyphea separatly, you could try finding what they have in common and.. apply this in another field.. etc. in short, **go play with the Lego blocks!**

But that's just me.<br>
Tell me what you do at.. oh, there is no way to tell me.<br>

Anyway, I am bored now.<br>
Go find out what the other things do.
