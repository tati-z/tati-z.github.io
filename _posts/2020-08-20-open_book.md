*#Take 2*

If I remember ..., I wanted to convert videos into books before accidently deleting everything I had written up until OVeR hAlF Of THIS PAGE -angry face-!

The reason I wanted to convert videos into books

- had space filling curves in it,
- lied on the projection from a Real plane to a Complex plane,
- mentioned degrees of neural connectivity and neuroplasticity,
- but also multidimentional thinking?
-    
-   
- guess we'll never know. Moving on...

It's **~~sensory overload!~~**

> Shut up!

# RAW data//
Okay after unpacking the RAW data, and singling out what I need, 
I don't care about the escaped quotes because: *regexp.*

What I didn't know though, was that there were new lines, reading between the lines. 
![dirty](/public/assets/images/dirty1.png)

This explains why lines in the earliest versions of this attempt never went past half of the screen.

![old version](/public/assets/images/old_attempt.png)

I liked this version a lot. It was CLI- based, and worked well. BUT. I HAD TO BE (OR NOT TO BE) On my~~**?**~~ "lap" "top".

With future versions, I want each line to be associated with links to timestamps, or maybe every 5 lines or so? so that I can jump to the point in the video if I decide: **I feel like it.**

# In the end,

~~Someday I may implement PDF format, if the need calls for it, but right now,~~
I am aiming for EPUB for its reflow feature that PDF doesn't know the smell of.

But also the ability to scan through a videos' content like... this:

So I can do...

th√¢t.


# And...what's in the middle?

OKAY, **it didn't happen.**<br>
Just as planned.<br>

It ended up being: **better than expected**.

### I figured out that HTML is all I ever needed! Phew..<br><br>
![very fast book](/public/assets/images/fast_book.png)

## Post-Credit Scenes
My favourite thing about coding is:
![would rather](/public/assets/images/would_rather.png)
And that's why this project was awesome!

> Because not only GNU is Not Unix, the cursor at the end of the list stopped because, apart from Finding, Designing, Testing and Writting, my other favourite thing about coding is: **Reading**!

But not only epub is bandwith heavier than HTML, there was one aspect of FastBook which I overLüëÄked.

**Instead of keeping each video book in ibooks, why not request it again?**üëÄ

Similar to cooking, versus watching a cooking show, I personaly find reading and ruminating more enthralling than watching and forgetting.

So with that in mind on how to use FastBook, this is how to ~~cook a book~~ boil as part of the ingredients.<br><br>

**1) Turn off the oven**

![where?](/public/assets/images/light.JPG)

To toggle the dark ~~mode~~ side, press the moon.
![moon](/public/assets/images/moon.png)

>> **The `*stars*` are sold separately.**

Can I at least have the monlight?

> Do you wanna go premium?

No.

> With a 1 month free trial?

Noo.

> 3 month free trial?

Nooo. omg, leave me alone!

> But premium is also free.

HuƒÅ?

**2) Touch the flame**

1. Too far
![out_of_sight](/public/assets/images/too_far.png)
2. Too close
![too close](/public/assets/images/so_close.png)

**3) I think it's TIME...to** ~~delete all the code and start all over again~~ **ASK WHAT TIME IT IS!**
![pascal](/public/assets/images/time.png)

The time icon toggles the time. (pretty self-explanatory). When you clicked on the timestamps toggled, what happened?

**5) Veni Vedi Vici**

> Just like the cover of this boiling pot, I get very annoyed when there is too much water in my soup.

![fork](/public/assets/images/fork.png)
That's why I designed this "fork" to "scoope" out the important ~~giga~~**bits**.

But in form of an arrow. Cause **I like when content "goes to the point"** ~~of the fork or?~~.

Ah the sky! so blue.. Namely the title, and everything else highlighted in that colour will have the luxury to be jumped to when you hit the target. <<this text should also be highlighted in sky blue. `TODO: do it..`<br>

You tried it? ~~and it didn't work on your computer?~~<br>

Congratulations, you successfully skipped to parts that were likely to be suitable starts. (which were also computed without you noticing --yay).

This is for all the intros out there, to which, unless your name starts with "R" and your surname is "Sapolsky", I just don't want to know if you have been absent ~~minded~~.<br>
I was never ~~settling on settling~~ following. I was just passing.

To find these starts, I am reusing backends from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that I worked on in the past to cut down the bushes, so there be no more beatings around bushes?
```TODO: now that I think about it: scaling it to every page I visit?```

**6) No, no, it's not the small talks.. I just find it hard to engage in conversations when Pascal is not around.**

> Who is Pascal?

Yes.

## Reading tips? haha

I can't be the only one who hates it when rereading a book, they find themselves removing highlights made by their past selves. That spoiler!

If I hadn't find a new hobby with the highlight feature, I could have removed it all together even.
**The solution to this is self-evident. <u>Leave the book clean for the next reader.</u>**

Another thing I personally noticed when highlighting was that my brain would start taking the highlighted information for granted and stop pondering about them because it'd now seem as if it had them on demand.<br><br>
Information measured is not worth evolving. No wonder the double slit experiment.

Obviously this, is as dangerous as taking pictures on a trip or a walk, because the reading itself, just like the moment itself is the actual take away.
Even the Uncertainty principle could back this up!

If there is anything worth remunating about, to the brain, if the process of reading is being interupted, this whole reading may becomes the equivalence of drinking water when brushing teeth. ~~If you brush your teeth at all.~~<br>

Sometimes, some people read comments and review before reading a book they want to read. How is this any different from taking a picture of a meal before tasting it?
Don't you know that anticipating a reward raises your dopamine level and makes you unable to enjoy the book or whatever process it is to the initial level?
Think about it, do you think being hyped beforehand turns the graph of your enjoyement into an exponential growth or an exponential decay one?

Why do you think social medias and those games are addictive? Do you ever match the same reward level you started with, or it's your hope to reach it again that keeps you up, like in Zeno's paradox of motion ~~or flirting~~?! How do you think gambling works?

If climbing a mountain and reaching the top is more rewarding than going down and reaching the bottom, why are you going down in hope to get to the top? ~~says someone sitting at their desk starring at the drizzle but thinking of going to the beach, nonetheless.~~

This is when taking notes afterwards, preferably after a pause (cause I think the brain needs time to package this information and you may forget it faster if you don't give it the time to store it properly. It might seem counter unintuitive in this high paced world we live in nowadays to still be listening to yourself by the time you finish saying those 4 letters; "wait", but every process needs time and if you can't rush a boiling kettle to ..., why are you rushing your brain to store cold memories? don't you know they will be even colder when you retrieve them?)

Another way to reinforce the storage is adding ember to it, every once in a while, they say you need to reference it, is it 20 times? Anyways, sometimes I just use the information in other settings. This way, it gets more opportunities to be remembered.
See it as having a worm bin and a garden separatly, or having a wormbin feed into a garden directly.
Now I have interest to keep the bin up to date, because other things depends on it; moving it from something available, to something indispensable.

Cause 20 times,lol, who hit their head to abide to facts like that?
Don't you know that if your brain knows it's doing something it does it worse than if it never knew in the first place? What do you think is the hardest part in acting natural? Is it the acting? or the natural? is it me? or those aren't meant to ever be in the same sentence?<br>

~~BTW, you are always being watched~~ <br>
Good luck acting natural now!<br>
~~jk?~~

If using this on MacOS/Ios, with the Web format, there is a way to markup the page. This automatically converts it into a Pdf file, also.<br>For epub, there is a built-in note feature in iBooks. I have absolutly no information on how this project works or displays on any other operating system, ~~and I couldn't be bothered.~~

But this might not be necessary if notes are:
- saved separatly, as a reflections, (which is "better"? imho?, like eating from your plate instead of eating from a pot? at a party? _yikes, do you know no shame?_ ~~GIVE ME THE POT!! _come baaack, I will give you my_ pl..~~)
- used directly in other applications or analysis from alien settings. e.g. If reading about worms then hyphea, what's the contrast between them? Maybe apply this in another unrelated field? Maybe, instead.. No, Maybe.. oh, maybe playing with legos is just fun in itself? Don't you aggree?<br>
Yes?<br>
No?<br>
Definitely?<br>
Naturally?<br>
"Naterally wicous"?


But that's just me..<br>
Tell me what you do at.. oh, there is no way to tell me.<br>

Anyway, I am bored now.<br>
Go find out what the other things do, ~~if you want.~~
